# 🏦 Loan Default Prediction System

A professional Machine Learning project developed to predict the likelihood of loan defaults using historical financial data. This project includes a trained model, data analysis, and a web interface built with **Flask**.

## 📊 Project Overview
This repository contains a complete end-to-end pipeline for predicting loan approval/default status. As a **Data Analyst/Data Scientist**, I built this to demonstrate skills in data preprocessing, model training, and deployment.

### Key Features
* **Machine Learning Model**: Built a classification model (Random Forest/Logistic Regression) to predict defaults.
* **Interactive Notebook**: Includes `loan_default_preduction.ipynb` showing the full exploratory data analysis (EDA).
* **Web Deployment**: Integrated with **Flask** for real-time predictions.
* **Reproducibility**: Includes a `requirement.txt` file for easy environment setup.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language**: Python
* **Libraries**: Pandas, Scikit-learn, NumPy, Matplotlib
* **Framework**: Flask (Web Interface)
* **Version Control**: Git & GitHub

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/sandeep21122/Loan_Prediction.git](https://github.com/sandeep21122/Loan_Prediction.git)
